# Calender_application

Hello Connections, I'm glad to share that I have been working on Calendar application that I developed in Java. This allows users to effortlessly manage events, set reminders, and organize attendees and it is easy to understand and modify.

ðŸ“† The Calendar class provides essential functionalities such as adding, updating, and deleting events. It also supports listing events within a specific time range, ensuring that you can stay organized and never miss an important occasion.

ðŸ”¸One of the amazing features of this application is the ability to add recurring events using the RecurrencePattern class. With just a few simple inputs, you can generate a series of recurring events, specifying the start and end dates as well as the interval in days. This functionality is perfect for managing events that repeat on a regular basis, such as weekly meetings or monthly reminders.

ðŸ”¹Furthermore, this Calendar application allows you to effortlessly manage attendees for each event. You can easily add attendees, view their details, or make modifications as needed. Additionally, it also provides a search feature, enabling you to find events based on attendee names or keywords. This ensures that you can quickly locate the information you need.

ðŸ”¸Additionally, I have added a random event feature, showcasing the flexibility of the application.

ðŸ”¹If you're interested in trying it out, feel free to check out the code below! I'd love to hear your feedback and any improvements you might have.
